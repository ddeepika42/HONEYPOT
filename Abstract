Password authentication systems, which are used as first level of defense, are now prone to many attacks. Enabling convenient login for legitimate users while preventing such attacks is a difficult problem. An important goal for authentication systems is to support users in selecting better passwords. We propose a new Password Guessing Resistant Protocol, using Honeypot Technique which is the art of detecting secrets and responding to computer misuse. The major goal of this work is to reduce the password guessing attacks. Well known security threats like Brute force attacks and Dictionary attacks can be successfully abolished using this protocol. The architecture of honeypot system shows that the system consists of a screen capturing mechanism which captures the activity of the attackers in the website.
